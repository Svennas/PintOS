Project for Pintos, course TDDB68.

This project contains work on lab 3 to 6. 

Code changes and commits for lab 0 to 2 can be found here:
https://gitlab.liu.se/gussv907/pintos-vt2020

Originally lab 0 to 2 was done with a lab partner, Leon Li Persson, 
in 2019 but this old project was located at https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/,
which has been taken down. 

Lab 0 to 2 was then redone the year after to better understand the labs.

Pintos was created at Stanford University by Ben Pfaff in 2004 and is an
educational tool where students are introduced to concepts in operating 
systems by implementing significant portions of a real one (Pintos).
